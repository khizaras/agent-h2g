# ImageKit Integration - User Guide

## What's Changed?

We've upgraded the image handling in Hands2gether to use ImageKit, a powerful cloud-based image service. This change improves performance and provides better image management.

## Benefits for Users

- **Faster image loading**: Images now load more quickly, especially on slower connections
- **Improved reliability**: Images are stored in the cloud, reducing the risk of missing images
- **Better quality**: Images can be automatically optimized for different devices

## What You Need to Know

### For Cause Creators

When you upload an image for your cause, the process looks the same, but behind the scenes:

1. Your image is temporarily stored on our server
2. It's uploaded to ImageKit's secure cloud storage
3. The temporary file is deleted from our server
4. Your cause displays the image from ImageKit's fast servers

### For Administrators

Admins will notice:

- No change to the user interface for managing causes and images
- Existing images have been automatically migrated to ImageKit
- The database now stores both the image URL and a file ID
- When causes are deleted, their images are automatically removed from cloud storage

## Troubleshooting

If you notice issues with images:

1. **Missing images**: If an image doesn't appear, try refreshing the page
2. **Slow loading**: If images load slowly, it might be a temporary network issue
3. **Upload problems**: If you can't upload an image, make sure it meets our size and format requirements

For any persistent issues, please contact support with details about the problem.

## Privacy & Security

Your privacy remains our priority:

- All images are stored securely in the cloud
- We maintain strict access controls
- Images are only accessible through our application
- We follow best practices for cloud security
