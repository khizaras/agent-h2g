  - Wireframes, UI mockups, branding assets
- **Phase 2: Development (6 weeks)**
  - Core features, backend setup, frontend integration
- **Phase 3: Testing (2 weeks)**
  - QA, user testing, bug fixes
- **Phase 4: Launch (1 week)**
  - Deployment, app store submissions, marketing launch
- **Phase 5: Post-launch (ongoing)**
  - User feedback collection, maintenance, feature updates

## 9. Risks and Mitigations

- **Data Breaches:**
  - Mitigation: Implement strong encryption, regular security reviews, and user education.
- **Low User Engagement:**
  - Mitigation: Incentivize participation, integrate social sharing, and gather user feedback for improvements.

## 10. Stack and Tools

- **Frontend:**
  - React.js, Antd, less, webpack, Babel, highcharts, react-router, reduxtoolkit, rich-text-editor
- **Backend:**
  - Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, googleoauth, multer, nodemailer, bcrypt, jsonwebtoken
- **Testing:**
  - Jest, Enzyme, Cypress

**Notes:**

- keep node_modules common across frontend and backend to reduce redundancy.
- Use a monorepo structure for better management of shared code and dependencies.
- Keep the user interface simple, appealing, modern looking and intuitive to encourage participation.
- Prioritize a balance between functionality and aesthetics in UI design.
- Integrate user feedback mechanisms for continuous improvement.
- Ensure security and privacy are foundational in all development stages.

**important:**

- Make sure you deliver a high-quality codebase think as senior developer and provide a well-structured, maintainable, and scalable codebase with end to end features.
- Do not provide a high level codebase, provide a complete codebase with all the features mentioned in the requirements.
- create backend and frontend directories in the root of the project.
- keep node_modules common across frontend and backend to reduce redundancy.
- generate a seprate webpack config files for development and production environments.
- use environment variables for sensitive information (e.g., API keys, database credentials).
- do not use lerna or yarn workspaces, as they are not required for this project.
- Do not use typescript, use babel for transpilation and its plugins for modern JavaScript features.
- Ensure that the project is easily deployable on cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Heroku).
